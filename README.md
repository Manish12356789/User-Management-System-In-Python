# User-Management-System-In-Python

User management system project done with core python code.
In this project, I used mysql as a database.

In this project, there is two type of user admin and normal user:

-> Admin can view, edit and delete the normal user and own information.

-> Normal User can also edit, delete and view own information.

In this project, there is three folders:

=> First: Controller -> Its like a middlewire, it connects models and user view.

=> Second: Model -> In this file, to connect with mysql database and make models as needed.

Third: View -> In this file there is a code for user view or user input.

All these views are run in console.
